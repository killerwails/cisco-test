Set up
=============
1. Import MYSQL mock data.
Run the following command:

`mysql < mockDB.sql.gz `

2.Start the server.
In the same directory as lookupApp.py run:

` python lookupApp.py` 

You should see the response:

http://0.0.0.0:8080/

Execution
=============
You will need three parameters: 

HOSTNAME
PORT
PATH_AND_QUERY

In another terminal, call the script with a curl like this: 

curl 'http://localhost:8080/urlinfo/1/HOSTNAME:PORT/PATH_AND_QUERY'

The script will respond with an OK if the url is safe. If there is a match in the database, it will respond with DANGEROUS

Unit Tests
=============

To run the unit tests: 

`python -m unittest test-lookupApp`
